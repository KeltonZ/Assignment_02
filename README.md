## Credit

Avery Cloutier: While I didn't copy his code, he helped me put together the things I read and figure out how to actually write this. I was really struggling to comprehend what the assignment was asking of me, but Once he helped me get past the initial stump it all clicked and I was able to complete the assignment quickly. Thank you Avery.

## The importance of Standardized code

Without following a standard set by PEP8 reading code can be extremely confusing and messy. Since most coding will be updating rather than creating new code, its important for the purpose of legibility and consistency to follow the format already set in place by the author. This reduces the chances of confusion or misinterpretation of code.

## Implementation of ethical habits

As described above, maintaining legibility, writing using proper indentation, and simplifying code in a manner which allows others to comprehend what you've written are some habits that will assist you when writing code.

## What you'll find in this assignment

Throughout this assignment you'll find the exploration and manipulation of different datatypes. I learned how to write, lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples, manipulating those variables and how to confirm the datatype. I will have now proved I understand how to show this and print these values. I enjoyed this greatly.
